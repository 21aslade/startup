# Notes

## GitHub

Pretty experienced with git and github, so I didn't learn much here - although
this is my first time setting it up on Linux! The Windows installs I've used
have always had Git Credentials Manager, so they were slightly less involved.
So, that's a cool thing.

## HTTPS, TLS, and Certificates

This is some good information to know! I'm glad Let's Encrypt is around;
using HTTPS by default is good for the web. It's nice to own a domain name
and stuff! I'm excited to keep moving forward in this class!

## React and CodeMirror

I learned a lot combining React and CodeMirror! It was tricky to figure out who should own what state, especially when both sides need to read the state (to say nothing of writing to it). I enjoyed the experience!
