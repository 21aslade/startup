# Notes

## GitHub
Pretty experienced with git and github, so I didn't learn much here - although
this is my first time setting it up on Linux! The Windows installs I've used
have always had Git Credentials Manager, so they were slightly less involved.
So, that's a cool thing.

## HTTPS, TLS, and Certificates
This is some good information to know! I'm glad Let's Encrypt is around;
using HTTPS by default is good for the web. It's nice to own a domain name
and stuff! I'm excited to keep moving forward in this class!
